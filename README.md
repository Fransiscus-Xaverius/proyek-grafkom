# proyek-grafkom
A WebGL project for my computer graphics lecture. Mostly using ThreeJS to animate and draw models.

# Preview
This is an implementation of the use of ThreeJS to animate, load, draw and run 3D Scenes/Models in a web browser

# First Time Setup
To run this project, these must be installed/available to use in your computer:
1. Visual Studio Code (A text editor with the necessary extensions).
2. An Internet Connection (This is necessary for the script as the index.html file imports three.js from a CDM link).
3. Live Server Extension (This is a Visual Studio Code extension that removes the need for you to install your own build tool such as parcel or anything similar)
